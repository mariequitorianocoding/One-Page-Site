## notes
This coding assignment was a challenging experience. I struggled with specific pieces of code, which affected the overall quality of my final product. If I had executed these sections correctly, I could have added more interactivity to my site and addressed more of the required criteria.

On a positive note, I feel like I achieved the aesthetic qualities I intended, such as the darker theme with red accents to convey seriousness.

Unfortunately, I misunderstood the assignment criteria and realised too late that I was supposed to provide my own text for the site. This misinterpretation impacted my execution greatly. It's a valuable lesson for me in the importance of reading assignment instructions carefully.

This assignment overall was a challenging but educational experience that will inform my approach to future projects.
